 * The interface <code>GossipMessageI</code> declares the signatures of
 * methods that must be implemented by messages exchanged among the participants
 * in the gossip protocol.
 *
 * <p><strong>Description</strong></p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * In a gossip protocol, participants exchange gossip messages to propagate
 * information through an overlay network. Such messages have an emitter, which
 * URI is stored in the message, a message URI to distinguish messages from each
 * others and a time stamp. Knowing the emitter, a receiver can avoid to send
 * it back a message just received from it. The message URI allows participants
 * to recognise messages that they have already processed and resent if
 * necessary, hence avoiding to flood the overlay network with messages that
 * have already circulated through it and its neighbours. Finally, the time
 * stamp is useful to manage the memory of already processed messages that can
 * be cleaned up of old messages information that cannot show up again despite
 * the unpredictable nature of the gossip message propagation algorithm.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The emitter URI is not meant to keep track of the initial participant that
 * introduced the message in the overlay network but rather to give a one-step
 * capability not to come back from a receiver to the immediate resender.
 * Therefore, whenever a message is resent by a participant, this participant
 * puts its own URI in the message before sending it to its neighbour. The
 * method {@code copyWithNewEmitterURI} is meant to help this process by
 * creating a shallow copy of the message changing only the URI of the emitter.
 * </p>
