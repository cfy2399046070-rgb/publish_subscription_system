 * The interface <code>GossipImplementationI</code> declares the signatures of
 * the methods to be implemented by the components participating in the gossip
 * protocol.
 *
 * <p><strong>Description</strong></p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * A component participating in a gossip protocol requires the component
 * interface {@code GossipSenderCI} and its method {@code send} to propagate
 * gossip messages to its neighbours. It offers the component interface
 * {@code GossipReceiverCI} with a method {@code receive} through which it
 * receives the gossip messages coming from its neighbours.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * To process incoming gossip messages, the component must implement a method
 * {@code receive} declared by the interface {@code GossipReceiverI}. The
 * traditional implementation of gossip protocols then use a method
 * {@code update} declared in this interface to both to integrate the incoming
 * messages in its state and to select the messages that it will propagate to
 * its own neighbours.
 * </p>
